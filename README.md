# digital_systems
All my code is from my digital systems class. 
The reports folder has everything about what each project is about. 
All of these were implemented on a Nexys A7-100T (Xilinx ArtixÂ®-7 FPGA family)

The lab_#.srcs files contain the main code for each project.
Inside the .srcs file, sources_# will contain the main VHDL code, and sim_# will contain the testbenches
